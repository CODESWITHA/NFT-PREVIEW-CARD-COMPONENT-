# NFT-PREVIEW-CARD-COMPONENT-CHALLENGE

<p> I had built everything needed for my HTML structure to build the nft card except the small line break design in grey. I haven't created one of these before so I ended up watching a tutorial ' How To Draw a Line With CSS (Horizontal or Vertical)' (see links) on youtube to see how to achieve this. </p>


***html***

<span class="line>      <--- this is me creating a link in my html to style it 

**CSS**

.line {
<br>
Border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc
<br>
Display:block;
}

***

  <p> I learned that setting the .line to <em> **display;block;* </em> meant that it would take up the <em> width </em> of its parent element which in this case is the <em> fieldset</em>. I applied these code my HTML foundation was complete. I was happy to then move onto the css. </p>
